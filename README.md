# Employee-Churn-Analysis-Project
The objective of this project is to
predict whether an employee will leave the company or not. By analyzing various factors and using machine learning algorithms, we aim to provide insights into employee churn and help organizations make data-driven decisions.
This project is done to understand and analyze the employee patterns in leaving the company and to develop a model to predict if further employees tend to leave as well. Various Data Science procedures have been utilized such as data preparation, data cleaning, data visualization, implementing machine learning/deep learning algorithms and evaluation analysis.
